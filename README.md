It is a model to predict if any person has heart related disease or not and then give the output as whether he needs treatment or not.
It will take the inputs from user. We have created various input fields on our html page which is required to predict the heart disease.
We have divided our project in three different sections.
The first section is a web page which takes the input from user using HTML forms and then we have designed it using CSS.
The second section is our Machine Learning model in which we use pandas, numpy and sci-kit learn libraries of python language.
First of all we have taken a dataset from kaggle and then read it using pandas in our model and then we clean it to get the required dataset. After that we have trained our dataset and then we use logistic regression. The accuracy of our model is 86%.
Then we integrate our model in web using flask.
