# Heart-Disease-Prediction
It is a machine learning model which will tell the useers that wehther he/she is having a heart disease or not or whether he/she need treatment or not.
Basically the model takes the input from user and then predict it using the model which I have integrated on the web app.
In this model, first of all I have taken a dataset from kaggle which is the dataset of various patients regarding their everyday health checkups like heartbeat, blood sugar level , etc. and then clean it and then filters the specific columns needed for the model to predict the right thing. After doing all that, I trained the dataset in 80:20 ratio and then use the logistic regression.
For deploying the model on the web app first I have created the HTML file for taking the required input from the users and then style it using CSS. And then I have created Flask app and deploy it successfully.
